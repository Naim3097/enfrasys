# Blog Grid Structural Fix - Complete

## Issue Identified
The blog.html page had broken grid structure due to:
- Duplicate and malformed HTML content
- Missing closing tags
- Mixed old and new card structures causing layout issues
- JavaScript selectors not matching the new card structure

## Fixes Applied

### 1. HTML Structure Cleanup
- **Removed duplicate cards** that were causing grid layout issues
- **Fixed missing closing tags** that were breaking the DOM structure
- **Standardized spacing** between elements for clean HTML
- **Ensured proper article structure** for all cards

### 2. Grid Container Integrity
- **Verified grid opening**: `<div class="grid grid-3 gap-lg">` (line 173)
- **Verified grid closing**: `</div>` (line 513)
- **Confirmed all cards** are properly nested within the grid container
- **Fixed card spacing** and formatting for consistent layout

### 3. JavaScript Updates
- **Updated search functionality** to work with new card structure:
  - Changed from `.card-title` to `h3` for titles
  - Changed from `.card-description` to `.card-content p` for descriptions
  - Added support for `.industry-tag` and `.resource-type-badge` in search
- **Maintained filter functionality** for content type filtering
- **Preserved animation observers** for scroll effects

### 4. Card Structure Consistency
All cards now use the standardized structure:
```html
<article class="card resource-item" data-filter="...">
    <div class="card-header">
        <div class="resource-type-badge [type]">Type</div>
        <img src="assets/tbc.jpg" alt="..." class="w-full rounded-lg mb-md">
        <div class="resource-meta">
            <span class="industry-tag">Category</span>
        </div>
        <h3>Title</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="card-content">
        <p>Description</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card-footer">
        <a href="..." class="btn btn-outline btn-sm">Action</a>
    </div>
</article>
```
