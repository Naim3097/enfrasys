<!-- 
CUSTOMIZATION NOTES:
1. Adjust timeline phases based on project complexity (3-8 phases typical)
2. Customize phase titles to match the specific solution type
3. Update descriptions to reflect project-specific activities
4. Maintain consistent timeline-* CSS classes for styling

EXAMPLES OF PHASE VARIATIONS:
- Cloud Migration: Assessment → Setup → Pilot → Migration → Testing → Go-Live
- AI Implementation: Discovery → Design → Development → Testing → Training → Deployment
- Digital Transformation: Analysis → Strategy → Pilot → Rollout → Optimization → Support
