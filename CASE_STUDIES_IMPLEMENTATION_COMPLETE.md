- âœ… Mobile-responsive layout for all screen sizes
- âœ… Professional phase badges with background styling

### **Content Standards:**
- âœ… Industry-specific timeline phases relevant to each project type
- âœ… Consistent 6-phase structure across all implementations
- âœ… Professional, technical language appropriate for B2B audience
- âœ… Clear progression from assessment to go-live with support

### **CSS Integration:**
- âœ… All case studies reference the optimized `portfolio-clean.css`
- âœ… No CSS variable conflicts or undefined references
- âœ… Consistent with global design system
- âœ… Proper hover states and transitions

## Next Steps (Optional)

### **For Remaining Case Studies** (8 without timelines yet):
The following case studies have CSS links updated but could benefit from timeline sections:
- case-study-energy-dr.html
- case-study-government-comms.html
- case-study-government-fsi.html
- case-study-international-school.html
- case-study-medical-centre.html
- case-study-medical-imaging.html
- case-study-moe-schools.html
- case-study-property.html

### **Implementation Template:**
Use `timeline-template.html` to add timeline sections to remaining case studies by:
1. Copying the timeline section from template
2. Customizing phase names for specific project type
3. Updating descriptions to match project requirements
4. Inserting between solutions and benefits sections

## Results
âœ… **14 case studies** now have consistent CSS styling  
âœ… **6 case studies** have complete timeline implementations  
âœ… **100% design consistency** across all implemented timelines  
âœ… **Professional, clean design** ready for production  
âœ… **Mobile-responsive** and accessible design  

The case study portfolio now maintains a consistent, professional appearance that can scale across all future case studies! ðŸš€
