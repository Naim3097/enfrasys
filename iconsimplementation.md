✅ ICON DESIGN & IMPLEMENTATION BRIEF
For Enfrasys Website & Digital Assets

1. 🎨 Icon Style
Type: Geometric, minimalist

Line Weight: Medium-to-bold

Shape: Mostly square or circular base with rounded corners

Fill: Solid or semi-solid; clean negative space

Style: Flat or semi-flat — no 3D or skeuomorphic shading

Visual Language: Enterprise-grade, not playful or casual

2. 💡 Visual Treatment
Glow Accent:

Soft electric blue glow behind or around icon

Used in feature highlights or hover states

Typically hex #00BFFF to #2AF5FF

Avoid excessive glow to maintain premium tone

Shadows:

Smooth, soft drop shadows for lifted effect

Offset 2px, blur radius 8px, 10–15% opacity

Used in blocks or on white cards for contrast

Contrast Rules:

On dark sections: white or neon blue icons

On light sections: navy blue or charcoal icons

Always ensure AAA legibility against background

3. 🧭 Placement & Usage
Aligned Left or Top-Left with headings

Paired with H2 or H3 headings — never floating

Minimum Use: 1 per content group or pillar

Never overused — priority is clarity, not decoration

Size: Uniform (suggested base: 48px or 64px square in grid)

4. 🔌 Thematic Purpose & Roles
Icons serve to:

Represent key solution areas and values

Simplify scanning and comprehension

Visually break content sections

Reinforce Enfrasys’ expertise in cloud, security, and AI

Avoid icons that are:

Too abstract without context

Overly complex or multi-layered

Photorealistic or cartoonish

5. 🔄 Responsive Behavior
Use SVG format for scalability

Adjust icon size and spacing dynamically on mobile

Glow/shadow interactions simplified or removed on small screens

Maintain clear tap/click area for accessibility

6. 🔧 Web Prompt Summary (For Devs or AI Tools)

Edit
Use a consistent icon system with geometric, minimal icons in flat style. Rounded corners, medium weight, solid or outlined format. Apply soft neon blue glow on hover for dark backgrounds; navy on light backgrounds. Avoid icon clutter. Each icon supports a content pillar (Cloud, AI, Security, etc.). Always paired with section titles. Maintain 48–64px standard size. Apply soft shadows sparingly. Icons are used for tech clarity, not decoration. Responsive and SVG-based.
